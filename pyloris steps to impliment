These instruction will help you to install pyloris and impliment it.
AS YOU KNOW IT IS Denial of Service Tool Written in Python.
I have tried it on my localhost and some my small website,it does slow it down but not complitely
you can play with its settings and maybe do it complitely.

you can download here:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyloris/files/pyloris/3.2/
THESE files have modules that are compitable  with python-2.x
but i used in python 3.x ,you can find some errors and bugs but that can be corrected.
(use of code editor like pycharm is helpful)
i will give code as correction

download tor and vidalia-relay-bundle for tor swicher.
Go to settings->advance settings->uncheck random passcode->give your passcode
and type it in tor switcher.
(this you will not find it in youtube and helpful)

some tips:
import _thread as thread
import queue as Queue
import tkinter(not Tkinter)

errors are mostly find in:
pyloris.py
libloris.py
tor_switcher.py
